# 🎮 Steamworks Deployment Guide

## Overview

When you enable Steamworks in `bakery.config.js`, Bakery automatically handles most of the setup. However, there are platform-specific requirements for deploying Steam DLLs.

## Configuration

```javascript
export default {
  steamworks: {
    enabled: true,  // Enable Steamworks integration
    appId: 480      // Your Steam App ID
  }
}
```

## Automatic Build Integration

When `steamworks.enabled = true`, Bakery automatically:

✅ **Creates `steam_appid.txt`** in the app directory (with your App ID)  
✅ **Copies Steam SDK DLLs** to the correct location  
✅ **Links Steamworks API** to JavaScript  
✅ **Initializes Steam** on app startup  

When `steamworks.enabled = false`:

❌ **No Steam DLLs** are copied  
❌ **No `steam_appid.txt`** is created  
❌ **Steamworks API** returns `isAvailable() = false`  
❌ **No Steam initialization** happens  

## Platform-Specific Deployment

### 🍎 macOS

**Build Command:**
```bash
./bake mac --dir examples/steamdemo
```

**Output Structure:**
```
dist/mac/
  └── steamdemo.app/
      └── Contents/
          └── MacOS/
              ├── steamdemo           # Universal launcher
              ├── steamdemo-arm64     # ARM64 binary
              ├── steamdemo-x86_64    # x64 binary
              ├── bakery-assets       # Encrypted assets
              ├── libsteam_api.dylib  # ✅ Auto-copied if enabled
              └── steam_appid.txt     # ✅ Auto-created at runtime
```

**Distribution:**
- ✅ Everything is inside the `.app` bundle
- ✅ Steam DLL is automatically copied during build
- ✅ Users just download and run the `.app`

---

### 🪟 Windows

**Build Command:**
```bash
./bake win --dir examples/steamdemo
```

**Output Structure:**
```
dist/windows/
  ├── steamdemo.exe        # ✅ Single EXE (launcher + assets + Steam DLL embedded!)
  └── steam_appid.txt      # ✅ Auto-created at runtime
```

**Distribution:**
- ✅ **Single file!** `steamdemo.exe` (Steam DLL embedded)
- ✅ Steam DLL is automatically embedded during build
- ✅ DLL is extracted to TEMP at runtime
- ✅ Users just download and run `steamdemo.exe`

**How it works:**
1. Build embeds `steam_api64.dll` into the EXE
2. At runtime, DLL is extracted to `%TEMP%\bakery_<pid>\steam_api64.dll`
3. Steam loads the DLL from TEMP
4. Everything works seamlessly!

---

### 🐧 Linux

**Build Command:**
```bash
./bake linux --dir examples/steamdemo
```

**Output Structure:**
```
dist/linux/
  ├── steamdemo-x86_64     # ✅ Single executable (Intel/AMD 64-bit + Steam SDK)
  └── steamdemo-arm64      # ✅ Single executable (ARM 64-bit)
```

**Distribution:**
- ✅ **Two architecture-specific binaries**
- ✅ `steamdemo-x86_64` for Intel/AMD processors (10 MB, with Steam SDK)
- ✅ `steamdemo-arm64` for ARM processors (9.6 MB, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- ✅ All assets embedded in both
- ✅ Users just download and run `./steamdemo-x86_64` or `./steamdemo-arm64`
- 💡 **Note**: Steam SDK only available for x86_64 (Valve doesn't provide ARM64 binaries yet)

**Steamworks on Linux:**
- ✅ **Works EXACTLY like Windows!** Steam library is embedded in the binary
- ✅ **Runtime extraction**: Library is extracted to `/tmp/bakery_<pid>/` at startup
- ✅ **Dynamic loading**: Uses `dlopen()` to load Steam API at runtime
- 🎯 **Solution**: Embed → Extract → dlopen() → Works perfectly!
- 🚀 **Cross-compile from macOS**: ✅ Fully functional!

## Testing Locally

### Development (with Steam running):

```bash
# macOS
./bake mac --dir examples/steamdemo
open examples/steamdemo/dist/mac/steamdemo.app

# Windows (cross-compile from macOS)
./bake win --dir examples/steamdemo
# Copy to Windows and run steamdemo.exe

# Linux (cross-compile from macOS)
./bake linux --dir examples/steamdemo
# Copy to Linux and run ./steamdemo
```

### Without Steam:

If Steam is not running, the app will show:
```
⚠️ [Bakery Steam] Steamworks is not available. 
   Make sure Steam is running and steamworks is enabled in bakery.config.js
```

All Steam API calls will return default values:
- `getSteamID()` → `'0'`
- `getPersonaName()` → `''`
- `isAvailable()` → `false`

---

## Steam Distribution

### For Steam Release:

1. **Upload to Steam:**
   - macOS: Upload the entire `.app` bundle
   - Windows: Upload `steamdemo.exe` (single file)
   - Linux: Upload `steamdemo` (single file)

2. **Steam will:**
   - ✅ Automatically provide `steam_appid.txt` (you don't need to include it)
   - ✅ Automatically provide Steam DLLs (but include yours as backup)
   - ✅ Handle updates and DRM

3. **Your app will:**
   - ✅ Detect Steam automatically
   - ✅ Initialize Steamworks
   - ✅ Work with achievements, cloud saves, etc.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Steamworks is not available"

**Causes:**
1. Steam is not running
2. `steam_appid.txt` is missing or invalid
3. Steam DLL is missing
4. App ID doesn't match

**Solution:**
1. Make sure Steam is running
2. Check `steamworks.enabled = true` in config
3. Rebuild the app: `./bake mac --dir <project>`
4. Check console for errors: `[Bakery Steam] ...`

### "steam_api64.dll not found" (Windows)

**Solution:**
1. Rebuild: `./bake win --dir <project>` (DLL is embedded automatically)
2. Check that Steamworks is enabled in config
3. Make sure the EXE is not corrupted

### "libsteam_api.so not found" (Linux)

**Solution:**
1. Rebuild: `./bake linux --dir <project>` (.so is embedded automatically)
2. Check that Steamworks is enabled in config
3. Make sure the binary is executable: `chmod +x steamdemo`

## Summary

| Platform | Single File? | Steam DLL Location | Auto-Embedded? | Cross-Compile? | Architectures |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **macOS** | ✅ Yes (`.app` bundle) | Inside `.app/Contents/MacOS/` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Universal (x86_64 + ARM64) |
| **Windows** | ✅ Yes (Single EXE) | Embedded, extracted to TEMP | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | x86_64 |
| **Linux** | ✅ Yes (2 binaries) | Embedded, dlopen() at runtime | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | x86_64 + ARM64 |

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Steam DLLs are **automatically embedded** during build if `steamworks.enabled = true`
- ✅ DLLs are **extracted to TEMP** at runtime
- ✅ `steam_appid.txt` is **automatically created** at runtime
- ✅ **TRUE single-file distribution** - no external DLLs needed!
- ✅ Everything works out of the box - just build and distribute!
