#  Pre-built Binaries

This directory contains pre-built launcher binaries and Steamworks libraries for all supported platforms.

##  Structure

```

```

**Total Size: ~3 MB** (all platforms + Steamworks)

##  Steamworks Integration

The Steamworks DLLs are stored **once** in `steamworks/` and copied to game bundles during build.

### Why Shared?

- **Smaller repo**: 1.3 MB instead of 3.4 MB (saves 60%!)
- **No duplication**: Same DLL used for all architectures
- **Easy updates**: Update once, affects all platforms

### Platform Details

| Platform | File | Size | Architectures |
|----------|------|------|---------------|
| macOS | `libsteam_api.dylib` | 406 KB | Universal (ARM64 + x64) |
| Windows | `steam_api64.dll` | 312 KB | x64 |
| Windows | `steam_api.dll` | 272 KB | x86 (optional) |
| Linux | `libsteam_api.so` | 379 KB | x64 + ARM64 |

##  Updating Binaries

### From GitHub Actions (Automatic)

Pre-built binaries are automatically built and uploaded to GitHub Releases by CI/CD.

Download latest:
```bash
bun scripts/download-binaries.ts
```

### Manual Build (Native)

Build on each platform natively:

**macOS:**
```bash
cd launcher
./build-macos.sh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
cd launcher
build-windows.bat
```

**Linux:**
```bash
cd launcher
./build-linux.sh
```

### Setup Steamworks DLLs

Copy Steamworks DLLs from `deps/` to `bin/steamworks/`:
```bash
bun scripts/setup-bin-structure.ts
```

---

##  Notes

- **Launchers are architecture-specific** (separate binaries for ARM64/x64)
- **Steamworks DLLs are universal** (macOS) or shared (Linux)
- **Windows includes both 32/64-bit** Steam DLLs for compatibility
- All binaries are **stripped** (debug symbols removed) for smaller size

---

##  Usage in Builds

Build scripts automatically copy binaries from `bin/` to game bundles:

```bash
./bake all --dir ./examples/steamdemo
```

Output:
```
dist/
 mac/
    steamdemo.app/
        Contents/MacOS/
            steamdemo              # Launcher
            libsteam_api.dylib    # From bin/steamworks/macos/

 windows/
    steamdemo.exe                 # Launcher + steam_api64.dll embedded

 linux/
     steamdemo-x64                 # Launcher + libsteam_api.so embedded
     steamdemo-arm64               # Launcher + libsteam_api.so embedded
```

##  Security

All binaries are:
-  Built from source in GitHub Actions (reproducible)
-  Stripped of debug symbols
-  Signed (macOS only, if configured)
-  Verified by CI/CD checksums

Steamworks DLLs are:
-  Official Valve redistributables
-  From Steamworks SDK v1.59
-  Unmodified (checksums match official release)
